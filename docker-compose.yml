# Development override
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In local development we often want the source on the host machine to be
# reflected inside the container for hot-reloading.  In Docker Compose this is
# typically achieved with a bind-mount, **but mounting an empty directory in
# production would hide the application code that the Dockerfile already
# copied into the image** and the import `app.main` would fail.
#
# To avoid breaking production deployments we keep the base compose file
# minimal and provide a second one – `docker-compose.dev.yml` – that adds the
# bind-mount.  Run it with:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
